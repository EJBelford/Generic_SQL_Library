A single indicator that information qualifies has foreign government information for which the source(s) of the information must be concealed.  Within protected internal organiational spaces this element may be used to maintain a record of the one or more indicators identifying information which ualifies as foreign government information for which the source(s) of the information must be concealed.

Within shared spaces, the data element serves only to indicate the presence of information which is categorized as foreign government information according to CAPCO guidelines for which the source(s) of the information is concealed, in which case, this data element''s value will always be "FGI".  The data element may also be employed in this manner within protected internal organizational spaces.  However, within the protected internal organizational spaces this data element may alternatively be used to maintain a formal record of the foreign country or countries and.or registered international organization(s) that are the non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s) of information which is categorized as foreign government information according to CAPCO guidelines for which the source(s) of the information must be concealed when the resource is disseminated to shared spaces.  If the data element is emplyed in this manner, ten additional measures must be taken prior to dissemination of the resources to shared spaces so that any indications of the non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s) of the information within the resource are eliminated.  In all cases, the corresponding portion marking or banner marking should be compliant with CAPCO guidelines for FGI when the source must be concealed.  In other words, even if the data element is being employed within protected internal organizational spaces to maintain a formal record of the non-disclosable owner(s) and/r producer(s) within an XML resource, if the resource is rendered for display wihin the protected internal organizational spaces in nay format by a stylesheet or as a result of any other transformation process, then the non-disclosable owner(s) and/or producer(s) should not be included in the corresponding portion marking or banner marking.';
